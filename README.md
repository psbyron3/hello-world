# hello-world

Hello,

I am currently self teaching Javascript and enrolling in coding bootcamps in the LA area. Decided to make the switch from my life in the service industry and get involved in tech and web development. Planning on being enrolled in a bootcamp Spring to Summer of 2016, then seeking a new career as a web developer. Lover of food, travel, exploration, hiking, camping, and I like to surround myself with good music, good people, and good beer! Oh and I don't know what that robot is talking about, Earth tacos are way better.
